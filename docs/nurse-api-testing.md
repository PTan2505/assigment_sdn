# School Nurse API Testing Guide

This document provides instructions for testing the School Nurse API endpoints related to the Medical Events management.

## Prerequisites

- Postman, Insomnia, or any API testing tool
- MongoDB running with sample data
- Node.js server running

## Authentication

For testing, you need to authenticate with JWT:

1. Obtain a JWT token by making a POST request to the login endpoint:

   ```
   POST /auth/login
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "username": "nurse1",
     "password": "password123",
     "userType": "medicalStaff"
   }
   ```

2. Include the returned token in all API requests as an `x-auth-token` header:
   ```
   x-auth-token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```
